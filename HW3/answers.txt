Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.43029262963

Problem 3:

Our variables that we need for the function is no longer define. Therefore it gives you the error
lenenum is not define.

When I comment out gc_count = 0 it would give me gc_count not defined error as well. gc_count is a define variable that counts up the total. 
therefore its a must to give it a variable 0 since we want the total count. 

Problem 4:

What I did was pretty much duplicate the loop that is already there. It feels too easy in this lab on purpose or I'm doing this wrong.

Reflection:

I gotta learn how to read more carefully instead of looking at the size of the content
Thought this lab was harder then it looks.
